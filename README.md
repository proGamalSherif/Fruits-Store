ðŸš€ My First Project Journey! ðŸŽ‰
I'm thrilled to share my first-ever project created using HTML and CSS during my ITI course! This milestone marks the beginning of my web development journey, and I'm truly grateful for the learning experience and support I've received so far.

Every line of code was a step closer to understanding the beauty of building websites, and I canâ€™t wait to explore more and grow in this field. Stay tuned for more exciting updates! ðŸŒŸ
